BattleShips, written in GROOVY.  Highly OO this implementation uses classes, abstract classes and features of the GROOVY Langauage.


this cannot be launched by npm start as we havent setup a package.json file yet.

we can start using, say at a lambda command propmt live-server, this will start the site and list all the fioles.. select game.html to see a rough working implementation.

i will use this app to learn typescript during the excercise of converting.
